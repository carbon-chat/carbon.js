Carbon.js is a ðŸ“– open-source, ðŸª™ free library for easily communicating with the ðŸ’¬ [Carbon API](https://github.com/carbon-chat/carbon).

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide ðŸ”’ secure, and ðŸŽ¯ robust messaging for everyone.

## How it Works

Carbon Clients connect to an instance of an [Carbon Server](https://github.com/carbon-chat/carbon-meta). The client uses this repository (Carbon.js) to communicate with the server to send and receive messages, voice and video calls, and more.

## Getting Started

Include the Carbon.js library in your project by adding our script tag to your site:

```html
<script src="https://carbon.proplayer919.dev/src/carbon.js"></script>
```

or by specifying a specific version:

```html
<script src="https://carbon-chat.github.io/carbon.1.0.js?version=latest"></script>
```
